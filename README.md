# Automate-ML-Model-Training_Streamlit

**A No-Code Machine Learning Training Platform**

This repository provides a user-friendly no-code machine learning training interface using Streamlit. It allows users to upload datasets, preprocess data, select models, and train them with just a few clicks. The project automates the entire ML workflow, from data handling to model evaluation, making it accessible for both beginners and professionals.

##🔹 Features

✔ Upload CSV Files or select from predefined datasets.

✔ Automatic Data Preprocessing: Handles categorical & numerical data, applies scaling, and splits into train-test sets.

✔ Multiple ML Models: Train with Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, or XGBoost.

✔ Custom Scaling Options: Choose between StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler.

✔ Performance Evaluation: Displays model accuracy after training.

✔ User-Friendly UI: Powered by Streamlit for an interactive ML experience.

## 🔹 Tech Stack & Libraries Used

🔹 Python – Core programming language.

🔹 Streamlit – Interactive UI for ML automation.

🔹 Pandas – Data manipulation and preprocessing.

🔹 Scikit-learn – Machine learning models & preprocessing utilities.
